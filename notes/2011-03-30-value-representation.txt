Let's say I decide to use a tagged word representation for the types, with
extensions added to accommodate user defined types and any other extension.

With that said I have to divide my values in two distinct categories:
 
- Immediate Values, that is, those that can be expressed inside the tagged word
  itself.
   
- Cell-based Values: those that need a cell to hold it's real value and whose
  tagged representation is that of a pointer to the cell.
  
XX I have the impression that I can represent a Symbol as an Immediate Value,
XX even though it's not possible to represent it's information in a subset of
XX a 64 bits register. It seems so because they are never freed, making it 
XX possible to represent it's pointer as an immutable/indestructible value
XX that we can just allocate and discard. Therefore, the Symbol would merely
XX hold as immediate value the pointer to the string it represents.

Although it's tempting to represent the symbol as an immediate value, I 
shall refrain from doing so at this stage, for it is premature optimization.
I'm not yet sure of how the handling of namespaces will relate to symbols
and, until that relation is very well specified, it is dangerous to limit
the possibilities of what information a symbol can carry.

On the other hand, it is still likely that the information held by a
symbol, whatever it may be, is never going to be freed, making it a good
candidate for embedding it's pointer as an immediate value.


The immediate value type category can handle much of the simpler/smaller
values we have in the interpreter, for example:

- Up to 32 bit (possibly up to 58 bits) integers;
- Character values, even 32 bit unicode;
- 32 bit floating point numbers;
- All the "special" values, namely:
    - NIL, the empty list;
    - #T and #F boolean constants;
    - UNDEFINED;
    - UNSPECIFIED;

The category of immediate values has enough unused space to make it even
possible to make the lexer to give out "lisp objects" from the get go, grouping
the tokens as immediate values, symbols and other atoms, as needed.
