To simplify [citation needed] the arithmetic operations on fixnum integers
represented as immediate values, I shall use the all-zeroes tag to mark
immediate values. That allow me to come up with a schema where fixnum values
are coded with low bits all clear, making it possible for some arithmetic
operations to treat it as if it was an untagged value.

So, the least significant byte of a immediate value looks as follows:
 x x x x ? 0 0 0

With the following signature for fixnums:
 x x x 0 ? 0 0 0

Of the remaining 7 main tag values, 2 must be reserved for cons cells (mutable
and immutable kinds), at least one must be saved for non-immediate atoms (which
can, if needed, be used to support symbols, bignums, vectors, strings and a
host of other types).

So far, I'm only worrying about the symbol type, so I'll define the atom tag to
be simply the next tag available.

That gives the following signature for non immediate atoms' last byte:
 x x x x ? 0 0 1
