Current Activity Tasks: 
  - Modify "lambda" forms to be able to handle more than one expression, with
    the tail-context properties and evaluated value rules described above;
  - Create a "begin" form like the one described below
      (begin <expression>+)
    that compiles into
      ((lambda () <expression>+))
